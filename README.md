week 8 weather forecast challenge. 

# Summary:
I have created a weather forecast application that allows users to search for the weather forecast in a city and view a 5-day forecast for several pre-defined cities. The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and displays it in a user-friendly format.

# Key Functions Used:

get5DayForecast(city): This function makes an API request to OpenWeatherMap to get a 5-day forecast for a specific city. It processes the API response and returns the forecast data.

displayCity5DayForecast(city, forecastData): This function takes the city name and forecast data, and displays the 5-day weather forecast in an HTML element. It formats and renders the forecast information.

addCityToHistory(city): This function adds the searched city to a history list displayed on the webpage.

# What Went Well:

I successfully integrated the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.
The application allows users to search for the weather forecast in a specific city.
Additionally, Iadded functionality to display a 5-day weather forecast for multiple pre-defined cities.
The user interface is clean and user-friendly, with responsive display cards.
Remember to include any other specific points that you think went well during the development of your application. Additionally, you can provide instructions for users on how to run the application or any future enhancements you plan to make.
